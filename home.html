  <h1>More brickbreaker updates</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The ball now bouncies off of the paddle in a better way, allowing for the place it hits on the pad to effect the direction
    in which the ball moves after bouncing off of it. I have also began to attempt to implement music. The nudge feature has been
    removed as it is no longer needed after i put in an update which added gravity to the ball, this stops it fron continiously
    bouncing back and forth horizontally. So that bug has been fixed. I am still working of implementing the special brick features
    , currently there is only one power-up. Later on i plan to implement other features, including a brick that when hit will make
    your paddle smaller.</p>

  <h1>Space Invaders</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I have began work on making a space invaders styled game recently. However currently i have only got the sprites for the aliens etc. 
  made. These sprites are also animated, which will be shown in a video in a later post. Once I have access to a screen capture software. 
  A non animated screen cap can be viewed below.</p>

  <h1>More brickbreaker updates</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Today we discussed what makes a user interface good, and things that need to be considered at the user interface design stage.</p>
<p>These are the points we agreed on being essential to a user interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Friendly</li>
<li>Customisable</li>
<li>Gltich Free</li>
<li>Controls are intuitive</li>
<li>Allows the use of multiple types of input device. i.e xbox controller or keyboard</li>
<li>Aesthetically pleasing</li>
<li>Appropriate sounds in-game</li>
<li>Surround sound capabilities</li>
<li>No slowdown / Lag</li>
</ul>

  <h1>Character Design, Level Design and Game-play/Mechanics.</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Throughout this week we have been working through a couple of sections, that will eventually end with a big report. The first topic discussed at the 
  start of the week was character design, during this lesson we discussed why it is important and how it effects the gameplay and narrative of the game. 
  Secondly we discussed Level Design, and what level design involves. Also discussing why it is important to have good level design, and the different parts 
  that make up a level. Thirdly we talked about the Gameplay/Mechanics within a game, this included what is involved in them.</p>

  <h1>Pong!</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I have been working on a version of pong. The game works in a very similar way to the brick-breaker game. However the pong game doesn't allow
  two players to head to head with each other, similar to a game of hockey. The game is in a fully functioning state and also has working scores
   for the two players. A screenshot is included below.</p>

  <h1>Brickbreaker Demo</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The html5 video posted below shows the game in its current working state, this includes power ups. I am currently working on adding more levels 
  to the game. As well as changing the art style that is in the game, as the current bricks will soon be replaced with more simplistic ones. Soon i 
  will upload a playable version of the game that can be downloaded and run on another computer, although that will be done whe n the game is pretty 
  much finished.</p>

  <h1>Video Game Narrative</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Today we looked at the narrative that is used in video games, and how it effects choices made in the design stage. The Narrative of a game includes the storyline, the objective, the characters and the theme ties.The narrative effects can effect the length that a game will be as well as many other important factors.</p>

  <h1>Brickbreaker Graphics Update</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I have been working on some of the graphics that are used in the brick breaker game to make them appear more professional. Slowly i will be updating each of the sprites and objects to match up with this new graphical style. The new start, win and lose screens can be seen below.</p>

  <h1>Brickbreaker Update</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Today i added a couple of new features to the brick breaker game. Now a start screen is included along with a win/lose
    screen. A special power block has been implemented, although it is not completely working, as once you have collected the
    power up it wont change back. Finally I have started to work on a nudge function, that only allows the player to nudge
    the ball twice in the game, although it is not completely working yet. I decided to implement this feature, as sometimes due
    to the way the ball bouncies off of objects in the game, it can become stuck in the loop of bouncing back and forth.</p>

    <h1>Brickbreaker</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I have been working on a brick breaker game. So far i have most of the functions of the game working, although i still
       have to implement a life system, power ups and switching level. Here are two of the levels i currently have in the
       game, more levels will eventually be made.</p>

     <h1>Legislation</h1><br><p>Some media assets are covered by copyright, this can include things such as sounds/music and graphics/
     artwork. To be able to use these you must seek permission from the original creator or pay the required amount. Otherwise
     the game creator will be breaking copyright law. Some game creators will be tempted to use copyright material without
     the permission. This has become fairly common on the internet where mp3 files are commonly shared. There is a large amount
     of legislation to cover these illegal actions, which will allow the creators to claim infringement against the people.<br><br>One
     of the legislation put in place is called the Digital Economy Act 2010. Part of this legislation aims to make the action of
     tracking down the infringers easier, this would be done by using the IP Address of the computer being used to identify the
     owner. Once the infringer has been identified then they can be prosecuted for breaking the law. Although most commonly
     repeat copyright infringers are the ones that get sued. As well as the previous mentioned actions, the Digital Economy Act
     2010 also allows for the owner of the content to get sites blocked from search engines due to having a large amount of
     copyright material that has been used without permission. The copyright holders will also work with Internet service providers
     to help block the websites; an example of this is the blockage of the website thepiratebay, which after long discussions
     with ISPs was blocked. However this does not always work correctly as all a website has to do is change its domain name,
     and then it is unblocked.<br><br> Due to the legislation that was put in place, the game creator must be careful where and
     what media assets they use in their game. This means that the creator of the game will either have to look for copyright
     free assets or buy the rights to use the certain asset. Many assets can be found for use under creative commons, this allows
     the licensing of some images to allow others to use them for their work legitimately. Other ways of acquiring the assets
     could be asking the original creator for the right to use them, although the original creator can say no. The final legal
     option that a game creator has to get assets is to buy them off of a site that sells them for use. Legislation throughout
     different countries can also differ. Some countries ban certain content from being used, these come under censorship laws.
     One example of this is in Germany. In the recently released Wolfenstein game any reference to the Nazis was removed from
     the German version of the game, due to the sensitive nature of the subject in Germany.</p>

     <h1> Assets for comparison</h1>
     <br>
     <p><b>The main characters from bounty 1 and bounty 2</b></p>
     <p>Bounty 1 uses a 2D character which works well with the main design style of the game. The characters design is based around the
       classic image of an old fashioned detective, which works well within the main theme of the game. The character is able to move up,
       down, left and right, however does not move diagonally. The walking animation used by the game makers seems very basic but does
       work within the style of the game. The game has footstep sounds when he moves, although they do not sound much like footsteps and
       unrealistic. The character is viewed from a static point within a room and the viewpoint stays the same in every room, with the camera
       being able to see everything in that room. <br><br>The 3D character used in bounty 2 uses the same view model as used in bounty 1.
       Bounty 2 makes use of a new walking animation that seems more realistic and less basic compared to the one in Bounty 1. The moving
       directions stay the same in Bounty 2. Bounty 2 uses footstep sounds that sound quite realistic. The 3D style of the character does not
       fit into the main design style of the game very well.<br><br>I believe that the character in bounty 1 is the better as the actually style and
       animation used for the character works better in the game. Although in a different environment the 3D design of the character in Bounty 2
       would be a better choice.</p>
     <br><br>
     <h1>Explain why these assets have been used by the game designers and the effect they have had on the two games.</h1>
     <br>
     <p>I think the game designer used the 3D character as to show the further development of the game from number 1. While the character
       used in bounty 1 was used as it fit in with the general style of the game. Although both were used as they both fit into the theme of the
       game. Both of the characters work in similar ways and the only difference is the graphical style. The out of place style of the 3D character
       has a negative effect on the game play, as it doesnt fit in.</p>
     <br>
     <p><b>The Inventory used in Bounty 1 and Bounty 2</b></p>
     <p>Bounty 1 uses a fixed inventory UI that stays in the same place throughout the game no matter where the character is or what the
       person controlling is doing.  In the inventory area commands are shown, these include Look, Get, Use, Talk, Move and shoot. These
       are used by selecting the command and then selecting the item or object that the user desires. This can result in a lot of repetition
       and can get some what irritating. The inventory has an image as its background that’s shows a gun and a detective badge that fits in
       well with the detective them of the game.<br><br>Bounty 2’s inventory system works very different. The inventory in bounty 2 is dynamic.
       It only shows when the label for inventory is hovered over. This means that it does not cover up any of the screen when not needed. The
       inventory UI is discreet. The commands available are also displayed in a dynamic fashion. When the item wanted is selected the commands
       available for that item pop up. This means that selecting commands is fast and repetitive.<br><br>The inventory system that was used in
       Bounty 2 was far superior to the inventory system in Bounty 1. The style fits in well with the game without being too intrusive on the
       players view point. The animations for the inventory are smooth, and the actions are made more intuitive.</p>
