  <h1>More brickbreaker updates</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The ball now bouncies off of the paddle in a better way, allowing for the place it hits on the pad to effect the direction
    in which the ball moves after bouncing off of it. I have also began to attempt to implement music. The nudge feature has been
    removed as it is no longer needed after i put in an update which added gravity to the ball, this stops it fron continiously
    bouncing back and forth horizontally. So that bug has been fixed. I am still working of implementing the special brick features
    , currently there is only one power-up. Later on i plan to implement other features, including a brick that when hit will make
    your paddle smaller.</p>

  <h1>Design Task 1(A)</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Gigabyte R9 280x Windforce 3X rev 3.0</h2>
  <p>Specifications :-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core Clock: 1000 Mhz, with boost 1100 Mhz</li>
    <li>VRAM: 3072 MB (3GB)</li>
    <li>Memory Bus: 384 bit, allowing for a bandwidth of 288 GB/s</li>
    <li>Max Resolution: 4096 x 2160</li>
    <li>3D Capable: Yes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The 280x has a total of 3GB of on-board video ram, this allows for gamers to play games at higher resolutions. This is because at high resolutions games demand more VRAM, with even 1080P using just under 2GB of VRAM in some cases. 3GB would allow gamers to play at the 4K resolution. The cards memory bandwidth of 288GB/s will allow the graphics card to render more data at once, meaning that the gaming experience given should be very smooth. The core clock speed of the graphics card operates at a higher speed than that of the stock AMD R9 280x, a higher clock speed will generally indicate better performance in the GPU. Which in the end will result in a better gaming experience for the end user, allowing them to play at higher frame-rates and on the highest settings.</p>
  <p>The 280x has support for all of the main gaming APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL, however it also supports AMD’s very own API that was recently released for their graphics cards. This new API is called Mantle, and it allows for AMD cards such as the 280x to get better performance in games that support the API. Some of the games listed to support it include the PC version of GTA V and many other EA games, including the not long announced Star Wars: Battlefront.</p>
  <p>Furthermore the 280x also allows for great 3D rendering, through the use of AMDs HD3D technology which can be enabled to enhance the experience gamers have when playing their games, allowing them to become more immersed in the world they are currently playing in. Although this technology is best used with high end systems, such as one which would include the 280x for a enjoyable experience. This technology is supported by a very large amount of games, including many high end games. Some of these games include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>StarCraft II</li>
    <li>Civilisation V</li>
    <li>Dirt 3</li>
    <li>Metro 2033</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Creative Sound Blaster Zx</h2>
  <p>Specifications :-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Signal-to-Noise Ratio: 116 dB</li>
    <li>Audio Processor: Sound Core3D</li>
    <li>Can power up to 600 ohm headphones</li>
    <li>23-bit / 192 kHz audio output</li>
    <li>Supports 3D surround sound</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The creative sound blaster Zx has a signal-to-noise ration of 116dB. This is important as a ratio greater than 0dB indicates that there is more signal than noise. This would mean that the sound that is outputted by this sound-card to a speaker etc will not have static or noise, leaving it crisp and without interference. This will be important when playing games as crisp audio will immerse the player further into the game that they are playing, and could also allow the player to hear things that they wouldn't hear with a different sound-card, an instance could be hearing an enemy coming up behind them. The card also supports an audio output of 192kHz which will allow the user to hear the audio in its pure form, so they are getting all of the detail from the audio in a game, that was intended to be heard by the creator.  It is also capable of powering very high end headphones, that would be hard to power without one. This means the user can listen to a games audio on whatever headphones, or speakers they like. As even the highest end headphones will not reach the limit of 600 ohms. The greater capability allows the player to use headphones that will output the games audio in as pure a form as possible, an output that would be similar to one that the audio creator would hear.</p>
  <p>The sound card has its own audio processor on-board. This means that all audio processing effects that are used will be unloaded from the primary CPU in the computer, onto the audio processing chip. This means that it could potentially improve the PC performance. Which would mean that the user would have a superior gaming experience from when they didn't use the card. The sound card also supports a suite that makes voice communication much clearer than before, which would be vital if someone was playing a team based game.</p>
  <p>It also has built in support for 3D surround sound, which will make the audio within a game appear much more realistic, and will immerse the player in their surroundings. Surround sound allows the user to tell which direction objects or NPCs are coming from, which will make the overall gaming experience better, the surround sound can be used to enhance scenarios that may take place during a game.

  <h1>Emerging Technologies</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Virtual Reality Technology</h2>
  <p>The Oculus rift allows for the user to “be in a game world”. It uses one screen for each eye. Each one has a resolution of 960×1080 
  on version 2. The version one had a lower resolution. Each one of the screens is 60Hz allowing to display 60 fps. Higher resolution 
  screens were added due to the fact the screens are so close to the user’s eyes, meaning that if the screens use a low resolution then 
  they will be able to see the visible pixels, thus destroying some of the immersion that the Oculus Rift allows in games .It uses a 
  sensor to direct the camera in game to move with the persons head in real life. The Oculus rift is still in development and is not 
  recommended for the general consumer to buy, instead only developers are recommended to buy it.</p>
  <p>The Oculus Rift allows for users to become more immersed in the games they are playing more than if they were looking at a normal monitor
  or television. The more immersive a game then the more enjoyable the user will find the game usually, of course there are some games that
  probably would not benefit from this as much as others. Such as 3rd person games like fifa etc. Although it has the possibility to enhance
  the experience of any 1st person game. There is currently a multitude of games that support it, including Minecraft(by mod), doom 3 and 
  Eurotruck simulator 2. This technology specifically helps with simulation games like Eurotruck simulator as it allows for the user to feel
  more there; other simulators have been inspired by the Oculus rift such as bird simulator.</p>
  <p>The creation of the Oculus Rift has inspired other manufacturers to start creating more virtual reality technology, such as the razer hydra 
  and the Virtuix Omni. This means that in the future virtual reality will become more predominant in gaming and games will become more immersive. 
  This may encourage the industry and users to begin to ditch the conventional TV or monitor in exchange for technologies like the Oculus Rift, 
  or the upcoming Sony VR headset that is not yet usable.</p>
  <h2>Steam Machines</h2>
  <p>The steam machine is a form of pc that has been introduced by Valve, the creators of steam. Although not all the steam machines will be 
  distributed by valve, and some will be made by different manufacturers. Each steam machine will have different specifications depending 
  on the price the user is willing to pay. It has been designed to fit into a living room environment and be suitable for the casual living 
  room gamer. The steam machine will be running a version of steamOS which is an operating system that is freely distributed by valve, although
  the user is able to change the operating system to whatever the desire.</p>
  <p>This will allow people to access the benefits of gaming on PC while not having to worry about building a pc by their self. This means that 
  gamers will come to expect higher quality graphics as the pc will be able to handle more than a normal gaming console such as the PlayStation 4.
  People will begin to expect much more from games than in the past, as they will now have access to much better hardware that can now display much
  more than was available using a normal console. It will also push more companies to moving towards an online distribution system such as steam,
  as it makes it much easier for gamers to access the games on the steam Machines, etc.</p>
  <p>The introduction of steam machines will push game developers to start developing their games for Linux, since steamOS is just a branch of Linux.
  This means gamers will, in the future, have the option between playing games on windows, mac OSX and Linux distributions. Which previously would 
  have been ignored due to the small demand that comes from the communities that use those operating systems.</p>

  <h1>Design Elements Report</h1>
  <br>
  <p>We are currently working on design report, in which we discuss the different design elements inside games. For this report I have chosen two game. These two games
   are Bastion and Borderlands 2. These games are not very similar and offer different selling points that will keep the player from putting the game down. I will be 
   focusing on 4 key areas; Narrative, Character design, Level design and Gameplay. I will go into depth on how these different aspects are used within the game.</p>

  <h1>Character Design, Level Design and Game-play/Mechanics.</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Throughout this week we have been working through a couple of sections, that will eventually end with a big report. The first topic discussed at the 
  start of the week was character design, during this lesson we discussed why it is important and how it effects the gameplay and narrative of the game. 
  Secondly we discussed Level Design, and what level design involves. Also discussing why it is important to have good level design, and the different parts 
  that make up a level. Thirdly we talked about the Gameplay/Mechanics within a game, this included what is involved in them.</p>

  <h1>Pong!</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I have been working on a version of pong. The game works in a very similar way to the brick-breaker game. However the pong game doesn't allow
  two players to head to head with each other, similar to a game of hockey. The game is in a fully functioning state and also has working scores
   for the two players. A screenshot is included below.</p>

  <p>The html5 video posted below shows the game in its current working state, this includes power ups. I am currently working on adding more levels 
  to the game. As well as changing the art style that is in the game, as the current bricks will soon be replaced with more simplistic ones. Soon i 
  will upload a playable version of the game that can be downloaded and run on another computer, although that will be done whe n the game is pretty 
  much finished.</p>

  <h1>Brickbreaker Update</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Today i added a couple of new features to the brick breaker game. Now a start screen is included along with a win/lose
    screen. A special power block has been implemented, although it is not completely working, as once you have collected the
    power up it wont change back. Finally I have started to work on a nudge function, that only allows the player to nudge
    the ball twice in the game, although it is not completely working yet. I decided to implement this feature, as sometimes due
    to the way the ball bouncies off of objects in the game, it can become stuck in the loop of bouncing back and forth.</p>

     <h1>Legislation</h1><br><p>Some media assets are covered by copyright, this can include things such as sounds/music and graphics/
     artwork. To be able to use these you must seek permission from the original creator or pay the required amount. Otherwise
     the game creator will be breaking copyright law. Some game creators will be tempted to use copyright material without
     the permission. This has become fairly common on the internet where mp3 files are commonly shared. There is a large amount
     of legislation to cover these illegal actions, which will allow the creators to claim infringement against the people.<br><br>One
     of the legislation put in place is called the Digital Economy Act 2010. Part of this legislation aims to make the action of
     tracking down the infringers easier, this would be done by using the IP Address of the computer being used to identify the
     owner. Once the infringer has been identified then they can be prosecuted for breaking the law. Although most commonly
     repeat copyright infringers are the ones that get sued. As well as the previous mentioned actions, the Digital Economy Act
     2010 also allows for the owner of the content to get sites blocked from search engines due to having a large amount of
     copyright material that has been used without permission. The copyright holders will also work with Internet service providers
     to help block the websites; an example of this is the blockage of the website thepiratebay, which after long discussions
     with ISPs was blocked. However this does not always work correctly as all a website has to do is change its domain name,
     and then it is unblocked.<br><br> Due to the legislation that was put in place, the game creator must be careful where and
     what media assets they use in their game. This means that the creator of the game will either have to look for copyright
     free assets or buy the rights to use the certain asset. Many assets can be found for use under creative commons, this allows
     the licensing of some images to allow others to use them for their work legitimately. Other ways of acquiring the assets
     could be asking the original creator for the right to use them, although the original creator can say no. The final legal
     option that a game creator has to get assets is to buy them off of a site that sells them for use. Legislation throughout
     different countries can also differ. Some countries ban certain content from being used, these come under censorship laws.
     One example of this is in Germany. In the recently released Wolfenstein game any reference to the Nazis was removed from
     the German version of the game, due to the sensitive nature of the subject in Germany.</p>

     <h1> Assets for comparison</h1>
     <br>
     <p><b>The main characters from bounty 1 and bounty 2</b></p>
     <p>Bounty 1 uses a 2D character which works well with the main design style of the game. The characters design is based around the
       classic image of an old fashioned detective, which works well within the main theme of the game. The character is able to move up,
       down, left and right, however does not move diagonally. The walking animation used by the game makers seems very basic but does
       work within the style of the game. The game has footstep sounds when he moves, although they do not sound much like footsteps and
       unrealistic. The character is viewed from a static point within a room and the viewpoint stays the same in every room, with the camera
       being able to see everything in that room. <br><br>The 3D character used in bounty 2 uses the same view model as used in bounty 1.
       Bounty 2 makes use of a new walking animation that seems more realistic and less basic compared to the one in Bounty 1. The moving
       directions stay the same in Bounty 2. Bounty 2 uses footstep sounds that sound quite realistic. The 3D style of the character does not
       fit into the main design style of the game very well.<br><br>I believe that the character in bounty 1 is the better as the actually style and
       animation used for the character works better in the game. Although in a different environment the 3D design of the character in Bounty 2
       would be a better choice.</p>
     <br><br>
     <h1>Explain why these assets have been used by the game designers and the effect they have had on the two games.</h1>
     <br>
     <p>I think the game designer used the 3D character as to show the further development of the game from number 1. While the character
       used in bounty 1 was used as it fit in with the general style of the game. Although both were used as they both fit into the theme of the
       game. Both of the characters work in similar ways and the only difference is the graphical style. The out of place style of the 3D character
       has a negative effect on the game play, as it doesnt fit in.</p>
     <br>
     <p><b>The Inventory used in Bounty 1 and Bounty 2</b></p>
     <p>Bounty 1 uses a fixed inventory UI that stays in the same place throughout the game no matter where the character is or what the
       person controlling is doing.  In the inventory area commands are shown, these include Look, Get, Use, Talk, Move and shoot. These
       are used by selecting the command and then selecting the item or object that the user desires. This can result in a lot of repetition
       and can get some what irritating. The inventory has an image as its background that’s shows a gun and a detective badge that fits in
       well with the detective them of the game.<br><br>Bounty 2’s inventory system works very different. The inventory in bounty 2 is dynamic.
       It only shows when the label for inventory is hovered over. This means that it does not cover up any of the screen when not needed. The
       inventory UI is discreet. The commands available are also displayed in a dynamic fashion. When the item wanted is selected the commands
       available for that item pop up. This means that selecting commands is fast and repetitive.<br><br>The inventory system that was used in
       Bounty 2 was far superior to the inventory system in Bounty 1. The style fits in well with the game without being too intrusive on the
       players view point. The animations for the inventory are smooth, and the actions are made more intuitive.</p>
